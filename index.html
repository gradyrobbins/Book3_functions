    <header>Battle of the Bands: see console for results</header>
    <section>A local nightclub is having a Battle of the Bands night in a few months. They expect many bands to sign up because the grand prize is $20,000. To make things easier on the nightclub management, they want each band to be assigned a number so that they can easily keep track of the order in which the bands will perform.

      Your job is to write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. The function will increment a global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number, and the band name concatenated together.</section>
